				<h4>Development Due Diligence</h4>
				<h5>Carrefour de la Rive Sud, Boucherville, QC</h5>
				<p>Signal reviewed the environmental and geotechnical characteristics of this 10 hectare site prior to purchase. The positive outcome of the review and testing resulted in development of this land as a retail power centre.

				<h4>Quarry landfill Decommissioning</h4>
				<h5>Dartmouth, NS</h5>
				<p>Signal negotiated for the removal of accumulated landfill material on behalf of the owners of this property and guided the decommissioning through to its conclusion. The rehabilitation of the landfill, versus enclosing, added enormous value to the land and created a net benefit to the owners. This former quarry is now eligible for redevelopment as both commercial and residential land as opposed to being an idle legacy to the owners and their neighbours.</p>

				<h4>Construction Performance Surveillance and Materials Control</h4>
				<h5>Dartmouth Crossing, Dartmouth, NS</h5>
				<p>Signal provided project management during the remediation and decommissioning of two asphalt plants on this 100 hectare site. After performing well during the rehabilitation stage Signal was engaged during the civil construction and building construction during property development. As a regional power centre this property offers small retail, restaurants, big box retail, and commercial office facilities and we have been instrumental keeping work on time and on budget. By providing construction surveillance and project management during it's evolution this property has been transformed into a bustling hub for the region.</p>

				<h4>LED Road Lighting Retrofit and Financing</h4>
				<h5>Providencia, Colombia</h5>
				<p>This picturesque island community in the western Caribbean was burdened by high fuel costs to run their generator that supplied power to the antiquated road lighting system. Signal provided a road light retrofit study, including a cost benefit analysis, to provide LED lighting for a 17km road around the entire island. Our services included sourcing financing and working with Export Development Canada to insure the project with a net cost benefit to the island community.</p>
