		<p class="lead">In North America, we spend 90% of our lives indoors, and yet our buildings are plagued by poor air quality. In a typical office building, lighting, heating, and cooling represent 65 percent of total energy consumption, and yet most buildings hemorrhage heating and cooling power. Energy efficient design and construction is not only the right choice for your bottom line, but also the best choice for a healthy life.</p>

				<h4>Site Assessment and Due Diligence</h4>
				<p>Understanding the suitability of a site prior to acquisition can avoid costly “surprises” during development. Signal Environmental assessments examine possible environmental legacy issues and provide solutions. Geotechnical assessments characterise soil conditions to provide insight on bearing capacity and assist with foundation design.</p>

				<h4>Project Design Support</h4>
				<p>High performance building projects start with a well-vetted design. For regional scale developments to individual buildings the most successful projects adopt an integrated design approach that relies on collaborative input. An inclusive approach builds better teams, increases efficiency, and improves overall outcomes. Signal Environmental offers integrated design support to improve specification development leading to the tender process and ultimately to a superior building.</p>
